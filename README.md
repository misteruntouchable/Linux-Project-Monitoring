### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we are going to walk through and set up a monitoring system within Linix using the Centos7 distribution.
Monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing data about the health and performance of your system. 
It is essential for preventing problems, identifying bottlenecks and ensuring that your system is performing at its best.
Poor system performance can have a number of negative consequences, including decreased productivity, reduced relaibilty, and increased
security risks. Proactive monitoring can help to identify and resolve problems before they cuase significant dusruptions.
 Some of the important keys to monitor are CPU utilization, Memory usage, Disk I/O, Network Traffic and Application Performance Metrics.
