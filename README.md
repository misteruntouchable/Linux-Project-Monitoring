<h1>Linux-Project-Monitoring</h1>

### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we are going to walk through and show how the monitoring system works within Linix using the Centos7 distribution.
Monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing data about the health and performance of your system. 
It is essential for preventing problems, identifying bottlenecks and ensuring that your system is performing at its best.
Poor system performance can have a number of negative consequences, including decreased productivity, reduced relaibilty, and increased
security risks. Proactive monitoring can help to identify and resolve problems before they cuase significant dusruptions.
 Some of the important keys to monitor are CPU utilization, Memory usage, Disk I/O, Network Traffic and Application Performance Metrics.

 - <b>iostat</b>
 - <b>sar</b>

 <h2>Environments Used </h2>

<h2>Project</h2>

  <h3>In this project I would like show how various tasks are completed using different tools</h3>

 <h4>We will show how  regular system resource monitoring works.</h4>
    In this task we want to set up the necessary tools on servers for regular system 
    resource monitoring.

  <h4>Schedule Monthly Performance</h4>
    This will examine how to use a tool such as sar to make a monthly performance reporting.

   <h2>Program Walk-Through</h2>
   <p align="center">
    Let examine the Top and the Systat Command <br/>

    <p align="center">We will start by by installing htop and sysstat in our Linux. This is done with the command "sudo yum install top systat". 
     Note: I have already installed these tools.<br/>
